# Protein selection

## Difference between immunological fluorescence and fluorescence protein fusions. 
||Immunolabelling|Fluorescent protein|
|-----|------------ |-------------- |
|probe palette|larger, including organic dyes|smaller|
|number of photons|higher when using organic dye|lower|
|Required condition|harsh|light|
