### Abstract
Recently, whole-*Drosophila*-brain structural mapping has been demonstrated with ~50-nm resolution, but not *in vivo*. In this work, we combine two-photon excitation into a spinning disk confocal setup to enable ~500 μm imaging depths in uncleared mouse brains (~100 μm in *Drosophila*), and wide-field optical sectioned detection, respectively. Through integration of photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM), which also reduces photodamage of the tissue, we achieve resolution down to ~50 nm in an intact *Drosophila* brain, pushing to the limit of imaging depth and resolution. Our work paves the way toward *in vivo* functional connectome studies. 

### Introduction

Super-resolution imaging avails the imaging resolution down to tens of nanometers. We have demonstrated whole brain structural mapping in a cleared *Drosophila* brain with ~50 nm resolution, but current optical clearing techniques do not allow *in vivo* observation. A technical milestone is to achieve *in vivo* whole brain imaging with similar resolution. Although *in vivo* super-resolution imaging has been realized, it is limited to thin samples. The underlying reason is that current state-of-the-art techniques rely on either saturation plus wavefront engineering or localization with blinking fluorophores. The former imaging depth is limited due to aberration or scattering in living tissues, and the latter suffers from lack of optical-sectioning ability.

In this work, we combine two-photon excitation into a spinning disk confocal setup to enable deep-tissue penetration and wide-field optical sectioned detection, respectively. The two-photon spinning disk microscope offers ~500 μm and ~100 μm imaging depths in uncleared mouse and *Drosophila* brains, similar to typical single-point detection two-photon microscopy. Through integration of photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM), which also reduces photodamage of the tissue, we achieve resolution down to ~50 nm in an intact *Drosophila* brain, pushing to the limit of imaging depth and resolution. More importantly, the protocol works for living brains, so our work paves the way toward *in vivo* functional connectome studies.
